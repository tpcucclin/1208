Q: 請翻譯
I still remember the night before my first day of high school. I wanted to
be perfect 1 on that first day. After everything was ready for the next day, I happily went to bed.
When I woke up the next morning, I was very excited. "Today is going to be awesome!" I thought to myself. However, when I saw myself in the mirror, I let out a cry. There was a huge red zit right on my nose!
I was really upset. The zit was like the work of mean little aliens! They landed their red spaceship right on my nose to ruin my first day of high school! I wanted people at school to know me as the "freshman IT girl," but now they would just know me as the "freshman ZIT girl!" I thought it was the end of the world!
Fortunately, the day went well , and no one said anything about my funny
zit! But for the rest of the year, I thought everyone would certainly talk about it every day behind my back .
The next year, on my first day in eleventh grade, I didn't get any trouble from those little aliens. I said to my best friend, "This is a much better way to start the year!"
"I don't understand," she replied.
I pointed at my nose and shouted, "Didn't you all talk about my huge zit on the first day of school last year?"
To my surprise, she said, "Certainly not, but you must remember my ugly haircut."
I paused and then said, "No, I don't."
I finally understood something really important. Most people only care about their own problems and have no time to think about others'.
The zit story is nothing but a funny memory now. It taught me to be more carefree and also to wash my face more often!
